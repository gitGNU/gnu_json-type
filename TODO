"dict" type object
------------------

Implement a new type object `{ "type": "dict", "args": [ $arg* ] }',
that is similar to the "object" type in that it matches JSON object values,
except that for "dict" the actual arguments can be given in any order and
some (even all) of the arguments specified by the type may be omitted from
the list of actual arguments.

Update (Thu Apr  6 17:12:58 EEST 2017): As of today, the basic "dict" type
object got implemented. Still remains for the next cycle of development to
allow "dict" types as elements of "list" type objects:

$ json -V -Tp <<< '{"type":"list","args":[{"type":"dict","args":[]}]}'
json: error: <stdin>:1:24: attribute error: invalid "list" type object: element is a "dict" (the "list" begins at 1:1)
json: error: <stdin>:1:24: {"type":"list","args":[{"type":"dict","args":[]}]}
json: error: <stdin>:1:24:                        ^
