"dict" type object
------------------

Implement a new type object `{ "type": "dict", "args": [ $arg* ] }',
that is similar to the "object" type in that it matches JSON object values,
except that for "dict" the actual arguments can be given in any order and
some (even all) of the arguments specified by the type may be omitted from
the list of actual arguments.
